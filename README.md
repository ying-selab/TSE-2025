# **How Can ChatGPT Support Human Security Testers to Help Mitigate Supply Chain Attacks?**  *(IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2025)*



The .xlsx file contains four sheets documenting library projects and the client projects that depend on them (including links to the corresponding GitHub branches).

Each table includes the following information:

1. Vulnerability entries — CVE identifiers and associated Jira tracking issues.
2. Affected libraries — the vulnerable library name, affected version(s), and the specific vulnerable API(s).
3. Library exemplar test — the test functions within the library that demonstrate or reproduce the vulnerability.
4. Client-level evidence — the client projects that invoke the vulnerable library and trigger the same vulnerability through a functional call.
5. LLM-generated results — outputs from ChatGPT, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview, and DeepSeek-Chat V3.
